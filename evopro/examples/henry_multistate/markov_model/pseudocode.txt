# outline for method to do bidirectional design with a frame shift

# premise: current bidirectional code (EvoPro, ProteinMPNN, etc) assumes perfect sense/antisense alignment
# what if we want to offset the bidirectional codons by an arbitrary number of nucleotide positions?
# this is not trivial to do with the current setup

1. run both designs through ProteinMPNN and calculate an initial fitness based on wildtype sequence

2. obtain the nucleotide sequences of each wildtype amino acid sequence 

3. implement a markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) model of nucleotide mutation
  4A. based on the arbitrary offset value, select pairs of nucleotides and randomly mutate them together
    - only allow mutations that follow bidirectional complementarity rules
  4B. after each nucleotide mutation, convert back to amino acid sequences and score both sequences again
  4C. if the mutation improves the ProteinMPNN fitness, keep it; also need to encourage bidirectionality
